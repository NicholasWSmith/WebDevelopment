	<p2><center> Megan, this is probably gonna be pretty weird now.  You're probs thinking "wow, these dude made a website AGAIN for me, what a one trick pony" or "yo, why aren't these sweet potato fries done yet?" Buuuuut either or its cool.  I wanted to make this to show how much I care about you, and how awesome the past three weeks have been.  Literally heaven.  It's so nice being with someone as funny, caring, and just amazing as you.  I made the video below, and I KNOW its kinda like Johan's idea buuuuut he had a good idea so imma use it. Thank you for being so awesome.  I love being able to get up in the morning knowing I can talk to someone as awesome as you.  Never change, you da bestest Hope you enjoy :)  Watch all the way to the end and full screen for best viewing experience! - Your BAE, Nick </center></p2>
