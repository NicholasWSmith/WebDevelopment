	+ "Nicholas Smith grew up in a small town called Carleton Place.  There were maybe 10,000 people and life was good. <br />"
	+ "I have always been interesting in video games, from a very young age. I first played 'Might and Magic (See Below) and it was the first RPG that I fell inlove with. <br />"
	+ "After that, I started playing a lot of Blizzard games such as 'Warcraft 3' and 'Starcraft'. My dad was also into video gaming, so it was sometthing that we always did as a family. <br />"
	+ "My older brother started to do something computer programming once he hit grade 9, and it fascinated me. At first I wanted to do it because I liked games, but after taking a couple of coding courses I really fell in love with it. <br />"
	+ "I never honestly thought I would get into Queen's. It was my application that was 'Oh haha, this would be a dream but it will never come true'. But, on one May evening it did come true and I was accepted to the Queen's School of Computing and I never looked back. <br />"
	+" After coming here for my first year I have been coding more heavily and I thoroughly enjoy it. It is something that I love to do, and can get paid quite well doing it. I have never been happier.<br /> "

	+ "There was only about 400 kids in the whole grade 9-12, so you pretty much knew everyone you went to school with. <br />"
	+ "This had many ups and downs as you can imagine. Rumors spread like untamable wildfire, but it was a good sound community and small <br />"
	+ "SO small infact, that I had my mother for my English teacher in grade 11.  Yup, my own mother taught me, and it was kinda awkward for the first couple of days. <br />"
	+ "I also made poutine one time It was great. It was candied poutine, and I felt it clog my artiries. It was for french class. C'est BONNE!"

	+ "It was been a fantastic experience. I have been able to do so many things, like hiking up mountains, canoeing, camping, everything outdoors has been fantastic <br />"
	+ "I mostly got into scouting because of my parents, and it was wonderful. They had us do so many things that they did as a child, and it was a really awesome bonding experience. <br />"
	+ "Over all scouting as made me much more mature, as I have been on several over night camping trips with just other kids my age.  It really makes you step up and become a leader. <br />"

	+ "Back in the summer of 2012, I got hit in the face with a canoe paddle and ended up losing my front tooth.  It was GONE!<br />" 
	+ "The doctor said it was one of the cleanest extractions he has ever seen, but that is a different story. <br />"
	+ "So, after the tooth was lost I had to go out and get a 'flipper' which is a type of denture. It looks like I have a tooth, but I am able to take it in and out whenever I please. <br />"
	+ "As you can imagine, I use this QUITE often.  Wether to fake getting it knocked out all over again, or for a kick ass halloween costume (See below) I find it quite ammusing. <br />"
	+ "Over my grade 12 year it was my thing, I was 'The Toothless Wonder' and I OWNED it. It was fantastic, and I loved it."
	+ "So, the missing tooth has become more of a part of me than the tooth I had to begin with."
